# C1 Arrival at Halwa

Together with the trade's caravan, 4 peculiar people arrived in Halwa, each with a purpose. The Half-Elf siblings, Shaya and Sirona, arrived in Halwa after months of tracking a dark creature. After a quick ask-around, they were pointed towards the Temple of Kor, the god of Wisdom. The Half-Orc Kor arrived, in search of someone who would be able to translate an ancient Medinan text. After a rather strange and confounding confrontation with a local librarian, he was directed to the same Temple. Lastly, the dwarf Thorean arrived there, on his way to Hajama's Bastion. 

On the other side of Halwa, a beautiful High Elf arrived, by the name of Luna. She was searching for someone who could help her in finding alliances to end the dragon war going on in her tribe. In the masses in the streets, she had found an elf with the same white skin and olive hair as her. She took Luna to the Fool and the Flask, and told her her name is Gandrayda. Gandrayda told Luna that she wouldn't find allies here, but that her fate lies at the Temple of Kor. 

Meanwhile, a small gnome was scurrying around the underground markets of Halwa, looking for magical items. He found a drow elven trader of information, Orim Sa'ri Haimii, who told him that he might find answers to his improbable quest at the temple of Kor. 

As fate would have it, all these peculiar characters convened in the Fool and the Flask, where they met eachother. The next day, they woke up to the friendly threats of Kor\(nelius\). They got ready and joined the Caravan leaving for the Temple of Kor.
