# C3 Ruins of Bryyo

The journey through the desert took 3 days. On their way, the group passed a small oasis and encountered some mummies inhabiting it. After setting it aflame, the mummies perished, and they found a small dagger embedded in one of them. During the first 2 nights, they noticed multiple shining eyes watching them.

In the third night, they were ambushed by a herd of Cranium rats. After disposing of most of them, the rest fled, towards what they presumed was the ruins of Bryyo.
