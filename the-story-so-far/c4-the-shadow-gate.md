Take a glimpse into the Mirror's Edge

The group investigates the portal in the Hall of Mirrors, and manage to open it by injecting their magic in it. At the other side of the portal, they find a very intrusive, harsh darkness. Light from their torches seems incredibly bright in this darkness, but seem to only cast their light a few meters, and colors seem to have disappated. However, it seems like they entered the same Hall of Mirrors, with the same hallway leading out of it as well. They walk back towards the catacombs in this dimension, to find it seemingly endless in one direction. One of them disturbes one of the tombs, and as a wave going over a lake, tombs start opening in the endless catacombs. The group panics and starts running towards an exit, which leads to stairs going upwards, seemingly endless. After a great while climbing the stairs, they decide to turn around, only to find the bottom of the stairs to be only a few steps back. They see the same door with the disc-symbols, only black and grey-rimmed, as colour has run out of this too. 

They come back onto the plaza, where instead of sand next to the plaza, now a black lake stands. They find a ghostly figure at a small pier. It tells them that everyone else has already left. Interrogation is halted by gargoyles attacking the group. The group explores some of the buildings, which eventually lead to a hall with tapestry leading to a great door. Four statues are near the doors. As Shaya closes in to get a good look at the details, notably the gemstones in their eyes, ghostly faces come out of the statues. They tell the group they are entering the Temple of the Lady of the Door, who has "saved them all". 

The Temple is an endless series of corridors of rooms and hallways, with seemingly no logic to what connects where. Almost every wall in every room or hallway is made of darkened mirrors. As they wander around the temple, they are haunting by a laughing wail, and are eventually attacked by a laughing spectre. In the many rooms, they find a riddle, seemingly like the one of the Lady of the Door and the rings.

She is an angel no one knows  
Only I may see  
 the Lady of the Door  
 they cannot walk along her Halls  
 of Thread they crawl from the sight  
 of their eyes.

Like blind and pious priests  
Their faith she welcomes them  
 belief and believer alike she saves  
 me she is an angel.

Sirona starts praying with her eyes closed, preaching towards the Lady of the Door, and disappears. She finds herself in a dark room with a painting of the Lady of the Door, a door leading back towards the first hall of the Temple, and a set of stairs leading upwards. She pries open the doors and makes sure for it to stay open, and searches the complex for her companions. As the hallways always lead back to the first hall, the group eventually find each other back there, and they follow the stairs up. 

They find a small workroom, with almost all surfaces dripping with candlewax. One of the walls is decorated with thousands upon thousands of rings. A dark hunched over figure is working on a worktable. His figure is hard to make out. He tells the group he is the last of the temple guardians. A thousand years ago, the Lady of the Door saved the inhabitants of Bryyo by bringing them to the so called Mirror's Edge.  She was one of the most beautiful creatures the citizens had ever laid their eyes on. The group tells them the way to get out might just be the way they got in here. He leaves Sirona and Thorion with a ring. Sirona was given a silver ring with a circle, a horizon and an upturned crescent on it, reminiscent of the symbol for Fharlanghn, and Thorian a silver ring with a scimitar on it.

The figure points them towards a door, through which the group can exit. They find themselves on a balcony overseeing the lake, and in the dark skies, they can figure out a dark shadowy figure with wings flying over. The group walks towards a tower, and feel a strong draft leading upwards in the tower. They find a bright, white portal, with winds leading right into it. After some deliberation, the group jumps in.
