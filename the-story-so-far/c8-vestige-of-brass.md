# C8 Vestige of Brass

After a short stay at the oasis of the Golden Falcon Inn, a quick glance of the Thri-Keen, and very dramatically plucking a flower, the group arrives at the Vestige of Brass.

With some help of Wishama, a tiefling with a magnificent skill in tattooing, the group finds out that a group of Fire Newts have been causing havoc in the Western parts of the Vestige of Brass during the night, but the guards will not do anything about it.  They feel like the commoners problems are not worth their time. Multiple people have already gone missing, presumably caught by the Fire Newts.The group heads out during the night to investigate. They fight some Fire Newts, and learn that people are offered to their new god. But the group are found and arrested by city guards, with the exception of Chuma and Sirona. Since they are Ajami, caught outside the curfew, they will probably be punished very severely.

Wishama helps Chuma and Sirona to gain audience with the Pashah of the Vestige of Brass. With some very carefully picking of words, Sirona manages to gain freedom for her friends from the Pashah. The audience of the others with the Pashah did not go so smoothly. They are now ordered by the Pashah to clear out whatever problems there are with the Fire Newts.

They find out the hiding place of the Newts, and investigate the caverns inside the Volcano-walls.
