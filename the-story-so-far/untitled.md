# C6 Route back to Halwa



After defeating the horrific plant monster created by a Mindflayer, the group heads out back to Halwa, in order to find more information on the possible hiding place of the psychic creature. But the route might not be as simple as hoped...

The group ride their camels towards Halwa. Their journey is somewhat slowed down by getting robbed near a Qasbah \(fortress\) on the trade route, encountering a group of traders who have their wagon stuck, and strange sightings and noises coming from the Ghost Mountains. The trip takes the greater part of 3 days. 

While almost arriving at the Temple of Kor, they notice a smoke plume arrising from the north. The ethoists ask the group to investigate the fire, which should be at the Bastion of Hajama, another place of religion. It takes a couple of hours riding on the camels to arrive, where they find the bodies of the ethoists of Hajama. Inside the burning building, a band of murderers revels in the fire and chaos they have created. The peculiars manage to fight them, and subdue one that they take back to the temple of Kor to interogate. They find out the band was led by Arafat, a crazed murderer working for the so-called Shadow Caliph, head of the Loyalists and the Everlasting. Arafat should be on his way back to the Shadow Caliph with a precious book of unknown source. 

The group track Arafat down in the Ghost Mountains, with the reluctant aid of their prisoner, and the help of a cute mountain cat. They fight Arafat, who was aided by two other clerics, who surrendered. The group finds out that the current Shadow Caliph Batina Al-Shaat and Thorion have a history together, from the times they were both Everlasting, fighting to subdue the Free Cities, before the year of the Azure Flames. For an as of yet unknown reason, the Shadow Caliph wants Thorian's head. Arafat gets defeated, and his 2 lackeys surrender, who tell the group that though he has always been somewhat maniacal, it has only gotten worse recently.

The book they find seems to be a necronomicon of some sort, written by someone called Velsharoon. On the first page, the following text was written: "When shadows grasp is no more, and her claims to the sands have faltered, find Deathâ€™s Embrace in Dweomerheart."  
In addition to the book, they also take Arafat's glaive, a mighty magical weapon.

The group returns to the Temple of Kor, and bring in the 2 lackeys for arrestation and further investigation. The half-elven siblings get a letter from their father. After a well-deserved night's sleep, Shaya awakens from a horrible nightmare. The group returns to Halwa to investigate the situation further, and to return the book to Huzuz. Chuma is reluctant to give away the book and studies it intently.
