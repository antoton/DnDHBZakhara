# C2 The Temple of Kor

The party set out for the temple of Kor at sunrise with the caravan, headed for the Temple of Kor and the bastion of Hajama. The caravan was ambushed by a pair of basilisks, and the guards got turned to stone, as well as Kor, Thorean and Shaya. The stone people were loaded onto the caravans, bar one poor guard, and rushed to the temple. 

At the temple, the ethoists of Kor performed a Restoration ritual, turning the poor stone suckers back to their original flesh selves.   
Shaya and Sirona were directed to the Ruins of Bryyo after informing about shadow creatures. Kor had to look for Rhundas at the same place in order to decipher an old text written in ancient Midani, as he was the only one proficient in reading the old texts.   
Meanwhile, Thorean went to prayer in a more silent corner of the temple, and was approached by one of the ethoists, urging him that his fate lies with the haphazard group he arrived with.   
The ethoists provided no answers for Luna, who was told that the people who would be able to help her should be at the temple. They deduced however, that as she was told to come here 'by fate', then perhaps she too, should follow the group of peculiars into the deserts.  
Some of the group heard some tales about one of the other ethoists, apparently going crazy and disappearing.

As the group departed the next day, they saw strange activities of small creatures at the temple. They decided to turn back and investigate. They followed a trail into a washing room. After opening a large cabinet and fighting flying robes, they found a body inside it, with its head missing.   
After interrogating a couple of the ethoists, the main priest begged them to head to Bryyo to find Rhundas, as he was probably in great danger.
