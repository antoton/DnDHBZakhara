# C7 Pelgrimage of Bektakats

Back in Halwa, Kor goes to the library to further investigate on the Mindflayer. He also inquires on the transcripted letter of Thibalt. The librarian tells them he recognizes words in simple orcish and other common languages. The group gathers together and look together to see if they can collectively translate the message. 

This is what they gather: \(Check with me what was written here, cause I forgot what I have given you already\). Parts are still untranslated, and the librarian tells them it looks like something as celestial, and something that tieflings might know. 

As they collect more knowledge at the library, the group is approached by a beautiful woman in flowing blue garments and opulant jewelry. She is Orana dal-Salaam, an ethoist of Selan, and invites the group to the ceremony of the moon at the Temple of Selan. In the meantime, Luna has gone off to buy an owl, as well as some live rats as food for the owl.

The group go to the temple, which is inside the Sultan's palace. People line up behind the gates to be allowed in and marvel at its beautiful gardens, reflective pools, which shimmer the stars and the sun in a magical way. 

The group is invited inside, where they are being treated with many drinks and foods, as they watch groups of handsome followers of Selan enter the building and being guided to the back. They see one special person exit a carriage, enrobed in the whitest robes they have ever seen, lined with golden threads. Their name is Bektakats Khimaksa, and is one of the few gifted with precognition. She is deemed one of the greatest sorcerers of Zakhara, and has devoted herself to Selan. She is welcomed by Orana, and leaves the hall.

Orana Dal-Salaam gathers the group in a small conference room with a round table, and tells the tale of the history of Selan, and her connection to Shar. Bektakats knows something horrible is coming, and that the group is closely connected to it. Somehow they are all related to it. She tells the group that Bryyo was a gatherplace for followers of Shar, and a mighty artifact was stolen when the ruins emmerged again. The creature that has been haunting these lands has it, and the followers of Shar will want to steal it back. Orana asks if the group can hunt for the creature, to make sure the artifact would not fall into the hands of Shar. 

Orana also asks for a private conversation with Luna. Sirona, not trusting of of Orana, decides to sneak and follow the two. As the two return to the conference room, Sirona follows, and confronts Orana with the quote from the book of Velsharoon: "When shadows grasp is no more, and her claims to the sands have faltered, find Deathâ€™s Embrace in Dweomerheart. " She answers it is eerily similar to something she just said in private to Luna, but assures she does not know anything of that last part. Orana points the group to a fellow they might have met before, one who pays with information. 

Chuma leads the group the the underground market, and head to the information broker Orim Sa'ri Haimii. He informs the group that there has been misschief in the Vestige of Brass, and even that was valuable information, as the Vestige of Brass is extremely strict in information and strict in its happenings. 

The next day, the group debates on going towards Huzuz, or leaving to the Vestige of Brass. A roc plagueing the route to Huzuz makes it almost impossible to safely travel, but an armored caravan would arrive the next day, guaranteeing safe\(r\) travel. The group decides to leave immediatly for the Vestige of Brass.
