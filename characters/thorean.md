# Thorean

An enigmatic and silent dwarf. Thorean is not keen on letting anyone know of his past, nor even his present. A man of few words, but those few words are always the wisest. Unsure where Fate would lead him through these uncertain times, Thorean has gone on his Zakharan Pelgrimage, in hopes for a new purpose in his life.
