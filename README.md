# Welcome to Zakhara

The sands are shifting. Old ruins in the desert are being uncovered. Rumours spread quickly about what can be found in the deserted buildings, not only in the cities, but even in the darkest crevices. For now, the a meriad of peculiar people find eachother, as dictated by Fate.

Visions and visits of a dark creature trouble 2 siblings, who followed a trail into the Zakharan deserts.

An elf, longing for peace for her tribe, seeks alliances within its sandstone buildings.

A dwarf, troubled by his past, hopes to find new life in the changing deserts.

A gnome too small for this world, looks for the greatest of powers in the blazing sun.

And a half-orc looking for answers to a dark secret.
