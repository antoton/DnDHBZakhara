# Shaya and Sirona

Shaya and Sirona are half-elven siblings, hunting an unknown dark beast for a couple of months now. They traced the beast into the sandy planes of Zakhara. 

Shaya is the younger of the two siblings. His young innocence is a source of frustration to Sirona, and joy to the rest. 

Sirona, the older responsible one of the duo, hopes the protect his younger brother from the dangers of this world.
