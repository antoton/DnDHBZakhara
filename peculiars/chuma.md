# Chuma

A small, hyperactive gnome, traumatized by his past, looks for a way to cure the uncurable: death. Not afraid to let anyone know of his purpose, Chuma seems the friendliest of necromancers one would ever meet. Always enthusiastic about meeting dead animals and humanoids, Chuma looks around for clues to solving the greatest problem to all life.
