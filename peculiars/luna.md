# Luna

A rather vain High Elf, hailing from one of the tribes in the Sempadan Jungle. She boasts her beauty at every opportunity, mostly by showing of her great assets given to her during puberty. 

Luna states she is a decendant of the Godess of the Moon, which is reflected in her white skin and olive hair. 

Her tribe has been at war with the dragons from the mountains to the north. She seeks alliances in the harsh deserts, but thus far has been unsuccessful.
