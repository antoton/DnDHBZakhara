# Kor

Kor, short for Kornelius, /backname/ is a very peculiar half-orc. Torn between the extremely distinct origins of his cultured human father and his savage orc mother, Kor desperately tries to combine the two. Armed with his sword Respect, Kor looks for answers to a mystery in the sandy planes of Zakhara.

One day, his old colleague and great friend Tibalt returned mortally wounded from his adventures in Zakhara, and gifted Kor with an important piece of paper before his last breath. A message in an unknown language, with a secret so great it must not fall into the wrong hands. In order to solve this murder case, Kor left his home and traveled southwards, in search for someone who could translate this mysterious message. However, as people were desperate to kill his friend, he knew not to divulge all information to just anyone.
